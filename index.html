            <br>
            <p>
                My name is Sebastian Rolett, a graduate from Bellevue University with a Bachelors Degree in Data Science. During my education at Bellevue I've learned how to
                apply various aspects of technology to help uncover valuable and actionable insights with data.

                In my free time I enjoy playing various board games and video games with friends and family. Currently I enjoy playing: Modded Terraria, Dungeons and Dragons, Baulders Gate 3,
                and Modded Minecraft.
                <br>
                I also really enjoy traveling. My last vacation was a 2 week trip to Japan. I throughouly enjoyed being able to explore the streets of Tokyo, visit the museum in Hiroshima,
                the country-side of Kesennuma, and see the sights of Nagoya. Getting to try some of the street food, and finding some hole-in-the-wall places to eat at was awesome. I have
                Plenty of photos of the adventure, some of them of castles, but most of the beautiful gardens and country-side. I highly recommend a trip there, especially if you have
                someone who can help translate.

            <br>
            <p>
                I aim to engage in a Data Science role that will uncover insights into data. These insights will provide details in how to predict market changes, determine key areas
                for improvment, or product opportunities. I also aspire to develop impactful skills that can be leveraged to produce impactful results for the company.
