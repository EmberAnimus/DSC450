            <h1>Analyzing the Impact of Inflation on Family Income and House Prices</h1>
            <h3>Project Description:</h3>
            <p> 
                This project aims to analyze the effects of inflation on family income and house sale prices in the United States. The data used in this analysis is sourced
                from the FRED economic database. The dataset includes information on the median sales price of houses, mean family income, and inflation rate for the US.
                Our primary research questions are focused on understanding how inflation influences the affordability of housing for families.

            <h2>Project Details</h2>

            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <p>
                    This report focuses on understanding how inflation affects family income and the affordability of houses. 
                    We will use data from the FRED Economic Data Database provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. We focused on three important datasets: 
                    Median Sales Price of Houses Sold in the US, Mean Family Income in the US, and Consumer Price Inflation in the US. 
                    The analysis will span from 1953 to the present, and the Median Sales Price of Houses data is collected quarterly. 
                </p>

            <h3>Data Collection and Challenges:</h3>
                <p>
                    To investigate the questions we had about the research we started by merging the three datasets we used into a single unified dataset. 
                    This let us easily compare the data and see how the variables relate to each other. Additionally this enabled us to more easily slice the data for a model.
                    Some of the initial challenges with the data stemmed from both the reporting rate of the data as well as the limited quantity. In total we only had
                    around 60 datapoints to work with, which makes it rather difficult to account for a variety of extneral factors, but also limits model accuracy.
                    Despite these limitations, through linear regression we were able to achieve some decent results.
                </p>
            <h3>Results: </h3>
                <p>
                    Our model performed quite admirably with the limited resources we had available. The model yielded an R^2 score of 0.58, indicating that whlie the model
                    is able to explain more than half of the variance with inflation and income alone, there are still other significant factors that are not accounted for.
                    Additionally, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was $29,308, for the typical house prices this isn't a significant amount of money, but is still more than what 
                    is preferrable. 
                    This means that while we were able to shed light on how inflation affects home affordability for familys, there are still other factors at play that needs 
                    to be accounted for. If we are able to properly account for these factors, we could create a model that is able to draw a very deep understanding the evolving
                    relationship between inflation, family income, and housing affordability.
