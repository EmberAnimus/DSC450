            <h1>COVID-19 and How It Might Have Spread</h1>
            <h3>Project Description:</h3>
            <p> 
                This project analyzes the CDC's COVID-19 case surveillance database, which includes a large amount of data collected during the pandemic.
                Our study aims to show how COVID-19 control measures affect public health outcomes. The goal is to uncover correlations and casual relationships
                between different factors and COVID-19 related outcomes by throughouly examining all available data.

            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <p>
                    The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global public health, prompting a wide
                    array of control and prevention measures. By studying a vast dataset from the CDC's COVID-19
                    case surveillance database, the report aims to understand the potential effects of these measures.
                    Our objective is to track the pandemic's timeline and demographic factors and evaluate how
                    preventive measures have affected them.
                </p>

            <h3>Data Collection and Challenges:</h3>
                <p>
                    Our analysis is based on a dataset containing over 100 million entries. Despite the impressive
                    size of the dataset, we have encountered challenges related to data integrity and missing values.
                    The lack of data in some categories, such as "case_onset_interval" and
                    "case_positive_specimen_interval," limits our ability to make precise conclusions. Additionally,
                    the presence of a substantial number of zeros in key areas further reduces the pool of viable data.
                    Also due to the large size, the amount of time it takes to work with the data is significant and can
                    make working with the dataset tedious. The data still has promise to give us important
                    information, even with the challenges. 

                    You can view a summary report of the data by opening the sweetviz report below. You can also download a copy of the report by visiting Kevin Arnold's 
                    repository.

            <h3>Results: </h3>
                <p>
                    Our analysis aimed to uncover valuable insights regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 control measures. We investigated how changes in data correlate
                    with key events in the pandemic, such as vaccine rollouts and varations in vaccine efficacy over time. Additionally we explored the impact of vactors such
                    as mask mandates, public closures, and hopsital capacity on COVID-19 outcomes. Our approach involved training a regression model to predict the number of
                    COVID-19 cases. This model was trained on case data between 01-2020 thru 12-2020. Then the model was asked to predict case amounts for months 01-2022 thru
                    12-2022. When comparing the predicted values to the actual values we found that the predicted values ranged from 4x to 12x more than the actual amounts. 
                    This produces a strong indication that had preventative measures not been implemented, we could have seen a much different world today.
